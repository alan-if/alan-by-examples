# The Alan Recipe Book

A collection of examples on how to implement various gimmicks and effects by using pure Alan code.
Examples are organized following _[The Inform Recipe Book]_ that ships with [Inform 7] — hopefully, in the course of time this will become a full fledged book, like its i7 counterpart.
